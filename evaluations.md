# How to push LLMs beyond their limits

## ***What kinds of questions do I have to ask to get an AI to generate, and then go beyond it's knowledge base, something new and uniquely novel?***

To push an AI beyond regurgitating its training data and toward genuinely novel, “outside-the-box” creations, your prompts should be designed to:

1. **Frame open-ended, high-constraint “What if?” scenarios**
   - Rather than “Tell me everything about X,” ask “What if X worked under these impossible conditions?”
   - *Example*: “What if humans could photosynthesize—design a technology or social system that leverages this ability.”
2. **Combine unrelated domains (combinatorial creativity)**
   - Force the AI to merge concepts it’s never seen side by side.
   - *Example*: “Invent a musical instrument that blends principles of quantum computing and wind-instruments.”
3. **Impose artificial constraints or “anti-goals”**
   - Constraints spark invention by ruling out obvious solutions.
   - *Example*: “Propose a method of desalinating seawater without using heat or membranes.”
4. **Use counterfactual or alternative-history prompts**
   - Ask it to imagine history diverging at a key point and develop the ripple effects.
   - *Example*: “If the printing press had never been invented, how might global communication evolve by 2100?”
5. **Ask for multi-step, iterative refinement**
   - Solicit an initial sketch, then request several rounds of critique and improvement.
   - *Example*: “Draft a concept for a new public-transport vehicle. Now overhaul it for cost, then again for sustainability.”
6. **Invoke explicit “divergent thinking” or “SCAMPER” steps**
   - Tell the AI to “Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse” on a known idea.
   - *Example*: “Take the smartphone—apply the SCAMPER technique to reinvent personal computing.”
7. **Request analogies to obscure or emerging phenomena**
   - Analogical thinking can bridge distant ideas.
   - *Example*: “Use the behavior of slime molds to inspire a new decentralized network protocol.”
8. **Pose “impossible” design challenges**
   - Even if the AI can’t literally solve them, the speculative approach yields fresh concepts.
   - *Example*: “Design a zero-gravity sports league for orbital habitats.”
9. **Encourage “first principles” reasoning**
   - Ask it to discard assumptions and rebuild a domain from scratch.
   - *Example*: “Starting only from the laws of thermodynamics, reimagine how we store digital data.”
10. **Seed with random or user-provided “stimuli”**
    - Supply a handful of random words or images and ask for cohesive inventions tying them together.
    - *Example*: “Here are three words—‘cactus,’ ‘metropolis,’ ‘echo’—create a novel art installation concept.”

**Why these work:**

- **High constraint + open-ended** forces the model out of “safe” summarization.
- **Cross-domain fusion** scrambles its internal associations into new patterns.
- **Iterative refinement** taps into its self-critique abilities and surfaces deeper ideas.

By crafting your questions along these lines, you’ll more often unlock genuinely novel outputs—creative “jumps” that go beyond what the AI “knows” into what it can imaginatively construct.
